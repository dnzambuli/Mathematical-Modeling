## Dynamics of SEIR + Dead

Modeling the dynamics of an epidemiological system using the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model with an additional compartment for the deceased (SEIRD) is a common approach to study the spread of infectious diseases. The SEIR model is a compartmental model that divides the population into different groups based on their disease status.

The SEIRD model extends the SEIR model by adding a compartment for individuals who have succumbed to the disease. The basic flow of individuals between compartments in the SEIRD model is as follows:

1.  S (Susceptible): Individuals who are not infected but can become exposed to the virus.
2.  E (Exposed): Individuals who have been exposed to the virus but are not yet infectious.
3.  I (Infectious): Individuals who are currently infected and can spread the disease to others.
4.  R (Recovered): Individuals who have recovered from the infection and are assumed to be immune.
5.  D (Dead): Individuals who have died as a result of the disease.

```

The transitions between these compartments are governed by a set of differential equations. Let's denote the respective populations of each compartment by $S(t),E(t),I(t), R(t),D(t)$ at time $t$. The basic SEIRD model equations are:
